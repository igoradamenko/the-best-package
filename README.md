## ⁉️ Why?

There are a lot of packages that do the same thing, but when we started development, we could not find the one
that solves all the problems we faced. So we decided to spend our best engineers 😎 time to implement this package!

## 📜 Philosophy

Our team strongly follows these rules:

1. Explicit is better than implicit.
2. Simple is better than complex.
3. Complex is better than complicated.
4. Readability counts.
5. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Using those rules in our everyday work we deliver the best products 🔝 and beat our competitors! 💪
